# Spam-Email-Classifier-NLP-ML

This project focuses on creating an efficient Spam Email Classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. The objective is to accurately identify and categorize emails as either "Spam" or "Ham" (legitimate) based on their content.

Key features of the project include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing email data for better feature extraction.
Feature Extraction: Implementing the TF-IDF vectorizer to transform email text into numerical features.
Model Training: Using the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to classify emails with high precision and accuracy.
Interactive UI: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for real-time email classification.
This tool demonstrates the practical application of machine learning and NLP in combating spam, enhancing productivity, and improving email security. The project serves as a valuable resource for understanding text classification and deploying machine learning models.
